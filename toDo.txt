*** See all toDo statements within the script files (search for 'toDo')

================================= backend ================================
1.  Create a database for all items in the game (array of items).  May 
be included in the Inventory.js script, or perhaps it's own script.  Must
then be added to the persistent local storage

2.  Create a class for enemies similar to Hero.js.  This does not need to 
be added to persistent storage COMPLETE

3.  Figure out how the attack/defend/battle system will operate

4.  Incorporate user code injection into the game (this also falls under front
end) COMPLETE

5.  Work with frontend team to make the game more interesting - figuring out
how each challenge with each enemies will go, etc.

================================= frontend ================================
1.  Create the characters and items that will be found in the game

2.  Create the game world and areas in html

3.  Write the story board/end goal of the game

4.  Decide how things will be formatted on the screen, the player characters,
the inventory display, battle screen, and the user input box (this coincides 
with #4 in backend)

5. Develop animations for the player characters/enemies

6.  Come up with ideas that make the game more interesting that can be included 
on the back end.  Maybe you need a certain sword to fight a boss, or a key to
unlock a certain door to the next area.
