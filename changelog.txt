initial commit.  Added functionality for character creation 
and inventory system

9/14/19 - Jason Allen

Developed functionality for persistent data storage on page
loads.  This will allow the character and inventory data to 
stay consistent across different areas of the game.

Changed to a shared inventory system between 3 characters.  Items
currently held by players are no longer present in inventory.
Equipping a new weapon or armor swaps the currently held one with
the one chosen from inventory.

Moved drop/pickup methods from Hero class to Inventory class. (These
functions are now party-wide)

Developed the first phase of user interaction with the game.
functionality with the inventory system is encapsulated by the
'Party' class which will be present in every .html file
