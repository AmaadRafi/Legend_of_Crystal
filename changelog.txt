and inventory system

Developed functionality for persistent data storage on page
loads.  This will allow the character and inventory data to 
stay consistent across different areas of the game.

Changed to a shared inventory system between 3 characters.  Items
currently held by players are no longer present in inventory.
Equipping a new weapon or armor swaps the currently held one with
the one chosen from inventory.

Moved drop/pickup methods from Hero class to Inventory class. (These
functions are now party-wide)

Developed the first phase of user interaction with the game.
functionality with the inventory system is encapsulated by the
'Party' class which will be present in every .html file
